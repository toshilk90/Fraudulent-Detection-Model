# Fraudulent-Detection-Model

This project is a fraud detection model using machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions. It analyzes a dataset of 200,000 transactions with features like customer details, transaction amount, location, and device type. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn and the model applies classification techniques to detect fraud. Key steps include exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall. The goal is to improve fraud detection accuracy and reduce financial risks.
